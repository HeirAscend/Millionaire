# Millionaire

This program creates a (poorly optimized) version of the popular game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" in Java. As this program is missing the audience interaction portion of game show, I took some liberties and made the "responses" random (but weighted in favour of the correct answer). This is one of my first Java projects, and it uses the HSA console. Looking back, the HSA console was one of the worst parts of Java programming for me, so I am glad I likely won't have to deal with it again.
